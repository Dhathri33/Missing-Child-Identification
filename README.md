# Missing Child Identification System using Deep Learning and Multiclass SVM

This project aims to identify missing children using **Deep Learning and Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. The system leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction** and an **SVM classifier for facial recognition**, helping authorities and the public locate missing children efficiently.

## üìå Features
- **Face Recognition Model:** Uses VGG-Face CNN for feature extraction.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Classifies extracted features to detect missing children.
- **Public Portal:** Allows users to upload images of suspected missing children.
- **Admin Panel:** Police officials can view uploaded images and verify results.
- **Database Integration:** Stores missing child records and public submissions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.6+
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn
- **Framework:** Django
- **Frontend:** Tkinter (for GUI)
- **Database:** MySQL, SQLite

The public can upload photographs of suspicious children into a common portal with landmarks and remarks. The photo will be automatically compared with the registered photos of the missing child from the repository, alerting higher police officials when a match is found.
